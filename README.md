# Launch plotting utilities
MATLAB utilities to plot data with consistent formatting for tech reports.

## Layout
```
example_data_import.m - Post-process raw data into Timetables, save to .mat
example_plots.m       - Load .mat files generated by data_import and plot
sample_data/          - sources for example plotting
+lplot/               - plotting library
```

## Usage
Put the `+lplot` folder into a folder on your MATLAB path (your current working
folder or `Documents\MATLAB` are sensible defaults). If you download the entire
repository as a `.zip`, you can extract the `.zip` into the target folder. You
can then `import lplot.*` or use `lplot.<function_name>` to access the
functions within. For more information, see the MATLAB Help articles on
[packages](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html#br_lltt)
and [the `import` statement](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/importing-classes.html#buva9qv).

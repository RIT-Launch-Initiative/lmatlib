# Launch MATLAB libraries
MATLAB utilities for data import/export from simulations, clean plotting, and simulation.

## Layout
```
data/     - data import/export
plot/     - plotting
sim/      - simulation
samples/  - usage examples
```

## How to download

Options:

* (Recommended) Click `New->Project->From Git` and link to the repository (the last part should be `lmatlib`, with no `/tree/main`). This pulls all required files and lets you pull new changes as they are published.
* Download the files you need into a folder on your MATLAB path
* Download an archive of the entire repository

## How to use

Options:

* (Recommended) [Create a MATLAB Project](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-projects.html) 
and [reference](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/add-or-remove-a-reference-to-another-project.html) `lmatlib`.
* Add the folders you need into your MATLAB path using 
[`addpath`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html)
* (If you only want to run `samples`) Open the project file (`Lmatlib.prj`).
